# ArduinoLCD

First Arduino Project - LCD Hacking   by Mark Paget

Components:  

Arduino Genuino Uno
Legacy LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) 
15 short leads
9v Battery (for testing pins) with red/black connector
Bags of patience

Objective:  

Produce numbers on 2 digit display (would have gone larger, but not enough pins on Arduino)
Using Arduino Code to control digits

Observations:

Arduino code can be difficult and sometimes requires going the long way
LCD was troublesome using 2 digits beside each other
Not sure how to use more pins, etc on Arduino - maybe some form of chip to control pin voltages (multiplexor)
Went with straightforward layout for simplicity - so Arduino pin to LCD pin, rather than using shielding, resistors or diodes.

Thanks Mark
